# Scenario - SERC Fd in Computing

SERC School of Computing (and Engineering) would like to better understand the demographics of students who apply for and study the Foundation Degree in Computing. Additionally, they are also interested in creating a ML model that can predict the likelihood of a student passing certain modules, based on their pre-enrolment assessment score and current module grades.
